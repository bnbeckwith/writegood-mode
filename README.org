* Writegood Mode

This is a minor mode to aid in finding common writing problems.  [[http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/][Matt
Might's weaselwords scripts]] inspired this mode.

It highlights text based on a set of weasel-words, passive-voice and
duplicate words.

* Basic Usage

First, load in the mode.

: (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/writegood-mode")
: (require 'writegood-mode)
: (global-set-key "\C-cg" 'writegood-mode)

I use the command key above to start the mode when I wish to check my
writing.

* Customization

The user is free to customize three main portions of the mode.

** Faces

   The three faces used pull from the default warning face and add
   subtle backgrounds.  There is a separate face for each check performed.

   - Weasel words (writegood-weasels-face)
   - Passive voice (writegood-passive-voice-face)
   - Duplicate words (writegood-duplicates-face)

** Weasel Words

   There is a large list of included weasel words, but you may have
   your own.  See the write-good-weasel-words variable to modify this
   list.

** Passive Voice Irregulars

   There is also a list of irregular passive voice verbs.  These are
   the verbs that do not end in 'ed' to signify past tense. This
   variable allow the user to modify the list as needed.
